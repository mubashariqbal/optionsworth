# optionsworth

When learning a new language, framework or library I like to build something small but real worldish.

OptionsWorth is a simple one page javascript app I wrote to try out [Vuejs](http://vuejs.org).

A simple stock options value calculator.

You can see the finished product at: [OptionsWorth.com](http://optionsworth.com)
